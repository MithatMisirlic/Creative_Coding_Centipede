# CentiCreep üêõ

**CentiCreep** is a creative coding project built using **p5.js** as part of a university elective.  
It features an interactive centipede that follows the mouse, eats randomly spawned food, and loses health over time. The project blends animation, game logic, and user interaction into a fun, engaging visual experience.

## Purpose

This project was created to fulfill the requirements of a pass/fail elective course in creative coding.  
While the grading criteria were minimal, the goal was to demonstrate animation, logic, and interactivity through visual design.  
**CentiCreep** was developed as a playful yet technical implementation of those principles.
